        <em>All statistics in this article refer to the 2021 Freight Frenzy Season.</em>
    </p>

    <p>A wise man once said “OPR is the den of foolish robotics teams." I say we build a city of fools.</p>

    <p>
        There’s a lot of truth in these words as OPR,
        <a href="https://blog.thebluealliance.com/2017/10/05/the-math-behind-opr-an-introduction">
            Offensive Power Rating</a
        >
        is kind of a statistic we, FIRST, made up. It doesn’t completely measure how good a team is on its own. Especially
        in years with remote events, OPR becomes less and less of the force it once was. The biggest flaw with OPR are the
        inconsistent teams. For example, take Team A that scores poorly in all their matches except one where they do exceptionally
        well, and Team B that does average in all of their matches. The boost in OPR from that match that team B receives
        will be higher than Team A’s, even though Team A may have contributed more in that match.
    </p>

    <p>
        For all its flaws, OPR still does a decent job at approximating a team’s performance. However, in the spirit of
        America’s Pastime, I’d like to introduce some pitches for new statistics we could use in FTC, to show a
        different perspective. Oh boy do I love making up numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
        Average Domination (AD): Average Domination is the statistic found by dividing your team’s average by the
        event’s average, simple enough. The team with the highest AD (not including remote events, refer to the previous
        report) is <a href="https://ftcscout.org/teams/16439">Team 16439, AlphaGo</a>, at the
        <a href="https://ftcscout.org/events/2021/USCHSNOQ1/matches">VA Norfolk Qualifier 1</a>. At this event, AlphaGo
        had an AD of ~2.8 meaning that they did about 3 times better than the average team at that event.
    </p>

    <p>
        League Domination (LD): League Domination is the statistic found by dividing your team’s OPR by your team’s
        average at any given event. This statistic both shows how lucky you are in terms of teammates, but also how you
        compare to the rest of your league (again not including remote events). For example an LD of 60% means that you
        did on average 60% of the work in every alliance you were in. Interestingly enough, at <a
            href="https://ftcscout.org/events/2021/USOKNEM1/matches">OK Newcastle</a
        >,
        <a href="https://ftcscout.org/teams/11344">Team 11344 - Merrit Oilers</a>
        had an LD of over 100%, 106% to be exact. When I saw this I thought my query must’ve been wrong or something, but
        upon checking their event you can actually see that their average was <em>lower</em> than their OPR. Something else
        of note is that AlphaGo ranks 7 on this list, which I guess makes sense.
    </p>

    <p>
        These are just some statistics I thought were interesting. Really you could apply this idea of “domination” to
        anywhere. Like Regional Domination, or Total Event Domination, or even Auto Freight Point Domination.

        We apologize for the delayed report this week, college applications exist and we appreciate your patience. I
        look forward to seeing you all next week with our first <em>Spin Up</em> Scouting report.
